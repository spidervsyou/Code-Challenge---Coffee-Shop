Coffee Shop Management System

This project implements a Coffee Shop Management System using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python. The system models the relationships between Customers, Coffees, and Orders in a many-to-many setup. A Customer can order multiple Coffees, and each Coffee can be ordered by multiple Customers.

Features
Manage Customers, Coffees, and Orders using Python classes.
Maintain object relationships where:
A Coffee has many Orders.
A Customer has many Orders.
An Order belongs to one Customer and one Coffee.
Track customer orders and coffee popularity.
Ensure input validations, such as name length and price ranges.
Additional aggregate methods to calculate total orders and average prices for Coffees.
